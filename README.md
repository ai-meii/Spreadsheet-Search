# Spreadsheet-Search
Looks for the user input in a folder of spreadsheets and returns the tab where the input was found. 

# Contents
The project consists of using the Google Drive API and python.  

# About 
This script was made by Ai Mei Zhang in 2025 for the Poggio Civitate Data Science program.  
Catalogued artifacts are given a *pc_number* and stored in casettes.  
A folder of spreadsheets keep track of which casette the artifact is stored in.  

# Going Forward
The script can take a while to run, because it parses through all existing spreadsheets and content.  
Currently it can take up to a minute. In the future, I hope to modify this program to operate faster.  

# Acknowledements
Thank you to Cole Reilly and my fellow data-science students, Caleb & Malie for all your help. 
Additionally, I'd like to thank Poggio Civitate's excavation staff & team for giving me the chance to work with data you've painstakenly organized.
